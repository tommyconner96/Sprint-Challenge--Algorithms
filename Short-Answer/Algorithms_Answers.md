#### Please add your answers to the ***Analysis of  Algorithms*** exercises here.

## Exercise I

a) O(n)

loop is dependent on the value of n and the while loop is while a < n^3, set a to a+n^2 thus the difference is n

b) O(n log n)

the outside for loop will keep running until n is computed.
it will run n times
the inside loop will take significantly less time to compute because it's multiplying by 2 each time so it will run logn times

c) O(n)

it's a recursive call and runs through it until n == 0

## Exercise II

Binary Search tree seems like the best way.
It will start in the middle, and then evaluates left and right.
it will cancel out half the options so leaving us with the smallest amount of broken eggs.

runtime: o(logn)
